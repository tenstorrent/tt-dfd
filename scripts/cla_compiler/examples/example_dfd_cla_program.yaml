# Example CLA program
# The 3rd read request from the source 0xfa on channel A is returning with an error. You want to find out what is causing the error. 
# Once the third response for the target address is sent, or if the value of "internal_signal_C" changes, you want to:
#   - capture the value of the internal signal "internal_signal_D"
#   - stop the clock for a scan dump
#   - perform a custom CLA action to block more requests from being accepted
